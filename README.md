## ðŸ§ª Test Automation PoC: Java, Cucumber, REST Assured & Guice
A Proof of Concept (PoC) test automation framework demonstrating a real-world hybrid test architecture combining UI and API testing using:

âœ… Java 11+
âœ… Cucumber-JVM for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
âœ… Selenium WebDriver for UI testing
âœ… REST Assured for API testing
âœ… Guice for lightweight dependency injection

This project is ideal for teams looking to implement a scalable, modular, and maintainable automation framework with clean separation of concerns and support for both UI and backend API validation.

# ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Demonstrate how to combine UI + API testing in a single BDD framework.
Use Guice for dependency injection (unlike many traditional Cucumber setups).
Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and maintainability.
Provide a scalable structure suitable for enterprise-level applications.

# ðŸ§° Key Features
- BDD with Cucumber
- Dependency Injection
- Modular Design
- UI Testing
- API Testing
- Configuration Management
- Reporting
